*** What vi3m does ***

vi3m is a tool for adding vim-like mappings to i3wm.

What this means is that you can configure a string of characters to an i3 action, type a prefix key, type that string of characters, and the action will occur. This uses pure i3 bindmodes, generated by a script.



*** Installation and Usage ***

Clone this repository to ~/.i3, such that vi3m.sh is at ~/.i3/vi3m/vi3m.sh.

Run the following in your terminal from the vi3m directory:

cp examples/config.py .
~/.i3/vi3m/vi3m.sh
i3-msg reload

After that, you should be pretty much good to go.



*** Configuration ***

Look at examples/config.py, which contains the documentation for how to configure vi3m.
However, for an initial explanation: if you hit `$mod+m', then type `abcd', i3-sensible-terminal will be run.



*** Notes ***

vi3m.sh should copy ~/.i3/config to ~/.i3/preconfig. It uses the preconfig as a base for all future actions. It will never overwrite the preconfig. This is deliberate to help make sure your i3 configuration is not clobbered. Despite this, I strongly recommend creating a backup of your i3 config somewhere outside of ~/.i3 until you get used to how vi3m handles.
Additionally, you ***MUST*** edit the preconfig instead of config to make any changes to normal i3 behavior permanent.

Lastly, the script will automatically change your reload and restart bindings to run vi3m.sh first. That way, when you use your normal reload and restart bindings, it will reload vi3m changes as well. As a result, if for some reason you do something really weird with those bindings, it might not work automatically, in which case you'll have to investigate yourself.
